  abstract  = {Optical degradation blurs text shapes and edges, so existing scene text recognition methods have difficulties in achieving desirable results on low-resolution (LR) scene text images acquired in real-world environments. The above problem can be solved by efficiently extracting sequential information to reconstruct super-resolution (SR) text images, which remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a Parallelly Contextual Attention Network (PCAN), which effectively learns sequence-dependent features and focuses more on high-frequency information of the reconstruction in text images. Firstly, we explore the importance of sequence-dependent features in horizontal and vertical directions parallelly for text SR, and then design a parallelly contextual attention block to adaptively select the key information in the text sequence that contributes to image super-resolution. Secondly, we propose a hierarchically orthogonal texture-aware attention module and an edge guidance loss function, which can help to reconstruct high-frequency information in text images. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on TextZoom dataset, and the results can be easily incorporated into mainstream text recognition algorithms to further improve their performance in LR image recognition. Besides, our approach exhibits great robustness in defending against adversarial attacks on seven mainstream scene text recognition datasets, which means it can also improve the security of the text recognition pipeline. Compared with directly recognizing LR images, our method can respectively improve the recognition accuracy of ASTER, MORAN, and CRNN by 14.9\%, 14.0\%, and 20.1\%. Our method outperforms eleven state-of-the-art (SOTA) SR methods in terms of boosting text recognition performance. Most importantly, it outperforms the current optimal text-orient SR method TSRN by 3.2\%, 3.7\%, and 6.0\% on the recognition accuracy of ASTER, MORAN, and CRNN respectively.},

  abstract  = {Many real-world sequence learning tasks require the prediction of sequences of labels from noisy, unsegmented input data. In speech recognition, for example, an acoustic signal is transcribed into words or sub-word units. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful sequence learners that would seem well suited to such tasks. However, because they require pre-segmented training data, and post-processing to transform their outputs into label sequences, their applicability has so far been limited. This paper presents a novel method for training RNNs to label unsegmented sequences directly, thereby solving both problems. An experiment on the TIMIT speech corpus demonstrates its advantages over both a baseline HMM and a hybrid HMM-RNN.},

  abstract   = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},
